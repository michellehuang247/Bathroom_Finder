            <div class="panel-body" id=blurbs>Transgender people have a gender identity or gender expression different from their assigned sex (which is identified at birth). The term "transgender" is often referred to as an umbrella term, as it encompasses people who are non-binary, meaning that they are not expressively feminine or masculine, as well as people who are genderqueer or genderfluid, meaning that they identify with neither, both, or a combination of male and female genders.

            Members of the transgender community often have trouble finding a restroom that makes them feel welcome. We hope our website will help more people find more safe bathrooms for their needs.</div>

            Mobility, visual, and hearing impairments are all types of physical disabilities.
